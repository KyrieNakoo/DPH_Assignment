# Confidence Intervals in R: A Primer

The general form of a confidence interval is 

$$\text{estimator}\ \pm (\text{reliability coefficient}) \ \times \ (\text{standard error})$$

We will learn more about confidence intervals in week 8. For the moment, the reliability coefficient $z_{(1-\alpha/2)}$ may be though of as a measure of our confidence with the following conversions:
* 90% confidence: reliability coefficient = 1.64
* 95% confidence: reliability coefficient = 1.96
* 99% confidence: reliability coefficient = 2.58

## Confidence interval of a mean

For continuous data in which summaries by the mean make sense, then the confidence interval may be calculated as follows

$$\text{estimator}\ \pm (\text{reliability coefficient}) \ \times \ (\text{standard error}) \\
\bar{x} \pm z_{(1-\alpha/2)} \  \sigma_{SE},\ \text{where} \ \sigma_{SE}= \sigma/\sqrt{n} $$

### Example

Suppose that we observe a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2 in a sample of size 20. Find the 90% confidence interval of the mean.

```{r}
# Enter the values
x_bar <- 5
x_sd <- 2
n_x <- 20

# Calculate the standard error
x_se <- x_sd/sqrt(n_x)

# Calculate the lower limit of the interval
x_ll <- x_bar - 1.64 * x_se; x_ll

# Calculate the upper limit of the interval
x_ul <- x_bar + 1.64 * x_se; x_ul
```

The results show that the 90% confidence interval of the mean is between 4.3 and 5.7.

## Confidence interval of a proportion

For proportions, the confidence interval may be calculated as follows

$$\hat{x} \pm z_{(1-\alpha/2)} \  \sigma_{SE},\ \text{where} \ \sigma_{SE}= \sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/n}$$

### Example
Suppose that we observe 12 successes in 67 trials. Find the 99% confidence interval of the proportion.

```{r}
# Enter the values
p_hat <- 12/67
n_p <- 67

# Calculate the standard error
p_se <- sqrt(p_hat * (1 - p_hat) / n_p)

# Calculate the lower limit of the interval
p_ll <- p_hat - 2.58 * p_se; p_ll

# Calculate the upper limit of the interval
p_ul <- p_hat + 2.58 * p_se; p_ul
```

The results show that the 99% confidence interval of the proportion is between 5.8% and 30.0%.
